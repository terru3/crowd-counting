|   ✔    | Create README and ROADMAP                                                                                              |
|   ✔    | Preprocess data, implement basic training code and MCNN model architecture                                             |
|   ❌   | Implement and compare other modern architectures such as CSRNet, Crowdformer, etc.                                     |
|   ❌   | Consider re-working the model objective to accomodate conformalized quantile regression (CQR) for conformal prediction |

# Crowd Counting

This repository contains an implementation of a Multi-Column Convolutional Neural Network ([MCNN](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Zhang_Single-Image_Crowd_Counting_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)) for crowd counting. Future plans include a training and implementation of CSRNet and other modern architectures as well as potentially a layered conformalized quantile regression component for conformal prediction.
